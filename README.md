👩🏻‍💻 Who am I?

I'm from Lyon, France

After graduating with a Master's degree in law, I decided to discover web development with an OpenClassrooms program. 

Passionate about computers since childhood, I trained myself for 3 years to live from my passion and become a front end web developer and SEO consultant.

The subjects that are close to my ❤️‍🔥 and for which I am on active watch are SEO, E-Reputation, compliance with GDPR and web development.

I also believe open source has a significant role to play in building a more vibrant, interconnected, humancentric, and evolutionary world. I plan to improve open source ecosystem and expand knowledge and access to as many developers as possible.
